        <p style="font-size: 13px">Addressing climate justice means making sure that communities have the resources to reverse or sustain the climate and adapt to changes. This means making sure they have access to things such as education, healthcare, and disaster relief. Nonprofits are helping communities that are affected by climate change and need support to create sustainable practices. An example of a sustainable practice is renewable energy. Public sociology helps by raising awareness, connecting people to resources, and pushing for policy changes that help those most affected by it. The Seattle office of sustainability and environment is a local group that supports smaller groups pushing for change as they also push for change in our local government when it comes to climate justice. A great way to get connected with the local community is joining Bellevue college's climate justice club to get help make a better living environment for everyone. A great place for documentation and information would be from <a href="https://climatechangeresources.org/">Climate Change Resources</a> and the green guides from the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-issues-revised-green-guides/greenguides.pdf"> FTC </a>.  </p>
