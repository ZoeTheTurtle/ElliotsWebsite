        <p>Katy Doyle, High School senior, <br>Issaquah High School, Bellevue college <br>Climate justice matters to me because I value stability in our earth for everyone. 
            I can see how low income communities are severely impacted by the environment due to social inequalities. I love exploring the outdoors whether it's playing soccer,
            hiking, biking, skiing or surfing and I believe we need to make changes now so we can all continue to enjoy it. I understand the data behind climate change and feel
            a responsibility to support systemic solutions for a more just and sustainable future.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>Elliot Holt, 2nd year <br>Bellevue College <br> If it's not obvious based on the domain name of the website I am a big fan of Jimmy Carter. In 1979 he gave a speech about the overconsumption that has become
        common place in the US, his malaise speech has stuck with me since I heard it placing a great importance on the climate for me.</p>
